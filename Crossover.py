    Mixes attributes belonging to two different parents to produce two children with

    crossover_params (containing crossover method). Object can then be used as a
    function that produces children according to the specified method.

    Attributes:

        '''Performs a uniform crossover on the two parents

        The uniform crossover method creates two child arrays by randomly mixing together
        information taken from two parent arrays. To do this, the method creates two arrays
        of ones and zeros -one being the complement of the other- with the same shape as
        the parent arrays. The first array is multiplied with parent1 and the complementary
        array is multiplied with parent2 before adding the results together to make child1.
        The exact opposite multiplication is done to make child2.

        Args:
            truss_1 (array): Numpy array containing information for parent 1
            truss_2 (array): Numpy array containing information for parent 2

                needed for the method.

        Returns:
