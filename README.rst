GASTOp is a **G**\ enetic **A**\ lgorithm for **S**\ tructural design and **T**\ opological **Op**\ timization.
Given a set of boundary conditions such as applied loads and fixtures, it will design a structure to support those loads while minimizing weight and deflections and maximize factor of safety. 

Look how easy it is to use:

.. code-block:: python
		
   import gastop
   # Get your stuff done
   gastop.do_stuff()

oh if only it were that easy

Features
--------

- Be awesome
- Make things faster

Installation
------------

Install gastop by running:

hopefully, if we ever get that working.
Or, just clone the repo and throw together a random collection of virtualenvs and package interdepencies until it runs without errors.
